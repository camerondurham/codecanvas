# Bundle Analysis and Monitoring Infrastructure

This document describes the bundle analysis and monitoring infrastructure implemented for the frontend optimization project.

## Overview

The bundle analysis infrastructure provides comprehensive monitoring of webpack bundle sizes to ensure optimal frontend performance and prevent size regressions.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Webpack Bundle Analyzer Integration

**File:** `webpack.config.js`
- Added `webpack-bundle-analyzer` plugin
- Configurable via `ANALYZE=true` environment variable
- Generates both HTML report and JSON stats

### 2. Bundle Size Validation Script

**File:** `scripts/validate-bundle-size.js`
- Validates bundle sizes against predefined thresholds
- Fails builds when limits are exceeded
- Provides detailed violation reports with recommendations

**Thresholds:**
- Maximum chunk size: 244 KiB (webpack recommendation)
- Editor bundle: 512 KiB (target reduction from 1.06 MiB)
- Index bundle: 244 KiB (target reduction from 696 KiB)
- Total application: 1 MiB (target reduction from 1.77 MiB)

### 3. Bundle Analysis Report Generator

**File:** `scripts/analyze-bundle.js`
- Generates comprehensive bundle analysis reports
- Provides quick summary of bundle composition
- Identifies largest chunks for optimization focus

### 4. CI/CD Integration

#### Earthly Integration
**File:** `Earthfile`
- Added `test-bundle-size` target
- Integrated into main CI pipeline (`run-ci`)
- Saves bundle reports as artifacts

#### GitHub Actions Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/bundle-analysis.yml`
- Runs on PRs affecting frontend code
- Validates bundle sizes and fails on violations
- Compares bundle sizes between PR and main branch
- Posts automated comments with analysis results
- Uploads bundle reports as artifacts

### 5. NPM Scripts

Added to `package.json`:
- `build:analyze` - Build with bundle analysis enabled
- `analyze-bundle` - Generate bundle analysis report
- `validate-bundle` - Validate bundle sizes against thresholds
- `clean-bundle` - Clean bundle artifacts

## Current Bundle Status

Based on initial analysis, the current bundles exceed recommended thresholds:

| Bundle | Current Size | Target | Status |
|--------|--------------|--------|---------|
| Largest chunk | 1.04 MiB | 244 KiB | ❌ 438% over limit |
| Second largest | 568.31 KiB | 244 KiB | ❌ 233% over limit |
| Total bundle | 1.77 MiB | 1 MiB | ❌ 177% over limit |

## Integration Points

### Development Workflow
1. Developers can run `npm run analyze-bundle` locally
2. Bundle validation runs automatically in CI/CD
3. PR comments provide immediate feedback on size changes

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. Bundle size validation integrated into main CI pipeline
2. Builds fail if bundle sizes exceed thresholds
3. Bundle reports saved as artifacts for analysis
4. Size regression detection on pull requests

### Monitoring and Alerting
1. Automated PR comments with bundle analysis
2. Build failures on size threshold violations
3. Bundle size comparison between branches
4. Artifact uploads for detailed analysis

## Usage Examples

### Local Development
```bash
# Generate bundle analysis report
npm run analyze-bundle

# Validate bundle sizes
npm run validate-bundle

# Clean bundle artifacts
npm run clean-bundle
```

### CI/CD
```bash
# Run bundle size tests (Earthly)
earthly +test-bundle-size

# GitHub Actions automatically runs on PRs
```

## Next Steps

This infrastructure provides the foundation for:
1. Monitoring bundle size regressions
2. Identifying optimization opportunities
3. Enforcing performance budgets
4. Tracking optimization progress

The next tasks in the implementation plan will use this infrastructure to:
- Implement dynamic module loading
- Create lazy-loaded editor initialization
- Optimize webpack configuration for code splitting
- Monitor optimization effectiveness

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `web-frontend/scripts/validate-bundle-size.js`
- `web-frontend/scripts/analyze-bundle.js`
- `web-frontend/scripts/clean-bundle-artifacts.js`
- `web-frontend/scripts/README.md`
- `.github/workflows/bundle-analysis.yml`
- `web-frontend/BUNDLE_ANALYSIS.md`

### Modified Files
- `web-frontend/webpack.config.js` - Added bundle analyzer plugin
- `web-frontend/package.json` - Added new scripts and dependencies
- `Earthfile` - Added bundle size testing target

This infrastructure ensures that all future optimization work can be measured and validated against performance budgets.
