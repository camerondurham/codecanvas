# 401X runner project

## Intro

The runner project is to create an interface for users to run their code remotely without having
to have any compiler on their machine. This is a work in progress project for TCSS 401X :)

### High Level Architecture Diagram

These components live in the following paths:
- browser front-end: does not exist *yet*
- command-line interface: `cli/runner/`
- API Server: `api/`
- CodeRunner: `engine/coderunner`
- Runner Containers: `engine/runtime`

## Dev Environment

Editors:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) from Jetbrains for free with an [educational license](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students)

Extensions setup docs:

- Writing Go in VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go
- Debugging Go in VSCode: https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/debugging.md

Recommended extensions (VSCode):

Search for these extension ids in VSCode and feel free to
add your personal favs:

- `golang.go`
   for running and debugging Go
- `ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl`
   for Windows WSL users
- `yzhang.markdown-all-in-one`
   for writing docs
- `waderyan.gitblame`
   to figure out who wrote that bad code


Docker:

We will likely end up using Docker and include instructions here. For now, you
can install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started) if you like.

### Server and Engine Setup

Installing `mockgen` to create mocks from interfaces:

```bash
go install github.com/golang/mock/mockgen@v1.6.0
```

Using Mockgen to create new mocks for testing:

Basic command structure:

```
mockgen -source ./path/to/file/with/filename.go -destinaion ./path/to/write/mocks/filename.go InterfaceName
```

Example:

In `engine/runtime/types.go` there is the interface `Runtime` that we would like to mock for unit tests.

We can organize mocks in a submodule by making the `engine/runtime/mocks` directory and provide that and a filename to write the mocked classes.

```
mockgen -source ./engine/runtime/types.go -package=mocks -destination ./engine/runtime/mocks/Runtime.go Runtime
```

### CLI Setup

CLI stands for command line interface.

#### Adding New Commands

Install cobra dependencies: (required to generate new CLI commands)

```
go install github.com/spf13/cobra/cobra@v1.3.0
```

Add new cobra command

```bash
# change directories into the CLI sourcecode
cd cli/runner

# add new subcommand
cobra add <CHILD_COMMAND> -p <PARENT_COMMAND>

# example:
cobra add childCommand -p 'parentCommand'
```

The [Cobra CLI Docs](https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/master/cobra/README.md) are a great reference too.

### Running the Server

During CLI or even server development, you will likely want to run the server during testing.

In the root directory `runner`, you can run the API a couple ways:

```bash
# 1. use the Makefile
make run-api

# 2. just use the go command
go run api/main.go
```

Usually you'll want to run the server in the background to you can do other
things with your terminal. However, you'd need to kill the process running on port `8080`
once you're done. You can use the `api/kill_server.sh` script for this.

```bash
# 1. run the API in the background
go run api/main.go &

# 2. once you are done, use the script to shut down processes on port 8080
./api/kill_server.sh

```

You can also use the `api/kill_server.sh` script if you see this error:

> error starting server: listen tcp :8080: bind: address already in use


### Go Tips

#### Working with Go Modules

Go Module:

```bash
# you usually will not have to run this since we should already have a go.mod and go.sum file
go mod init github.com/<name>/<repo-name>

# add new library
go get <new dependency>

# organize modules and dependencies
go mod tidy

# remove dependency
go mod edit -dropreplace github.com/go-chi/chi
```

### Documentation

When writing instructions for users and in the README, please follow syntax recommended by [google developer docs](https://developers.google.com/style/code-syntax)


### Other things

#### Change package name (just in case)

```
# change module name in all files
 find . -type f \( -name '*.go' -o -name '*.mod' \) -exec sed -i -e "s;container-helper;ch;g" {} +
```

### Concepts

- **Systems Design:** The service involves designing a 3+ part application to handle the user-interface, API server, and remote code runner.
- **Containers:** Each part of the service will be run in a container, at least for local testing. Container primitives like filesystem and namespace/process isolation will also be used to protect the host system from each process running the user's code.
- **Basic Multi-Tenant Design & Security:** Remote code can be extremely malicious. This project must handle a basic set of attacks for its first iteration.
