## Intro

The runner project is to create an interface for users to run their code remotely without having
to have any compiler on their machine. This is a work in progress project for TCSS 401X :)

Docker:

We will likely end up using Docker and include instructions here. For now, you
can install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started) if you like.

## Development

This repository is primarily written in Go and the Makefile has a helper
commands to make development easier and more consistent.

> Note: before you start development, please run `make install-hooks`
> to install [Git Hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks)
> in your repository's `.git/hooks` directory. This will install a pre-commit
> hook that automatically formats your code with [gofmt](https://go.dev/blog/gofmt).

### Using the Makefile

By now, you are probably familiar with Makefiles. If not, this
wiki provides a great summary: [cs104/wiki/makefile](https://bytes.usc.edu/cs104/wiki/makefile/) (written by Leif Wesche).

Here's a quick summary of what the targets will do:

```bash
# print out all the makefile targets
make

# create or create mocks for unit testing, helpful if you have
# modified any of the interfaces in a `types.go` file
make gen-mocks

# run the API server (blocking, you can't use the terminal anymore)
make run-api

# run the API server in the background (you'll have to shut it down later)
make run-api-bg

# kill the server if it's running (this works by killing the process using port 8080, the API port)
make kill-api

# run all tests in the repository
make test

# run go fmt on the repository to format your code
make fmt

# run the golang-lint-ci on the package to find common mistakes or unused data structures
make lint

# install git-hooks to automatically format your code before you commit
make install-hooks
```

### CLI Setup

CLI stands for command line interface.

#### Installing the `cobra` CLI to help with codegen

Install cobra dependencies: (required to generate new CLI commands)

```bash
go install github.com/spf13/cobra/cobra@v1.3.0
```

#### Adding New Commands

Add new cobra command

```bash
# change directories into the CLI sourcecode
cd cli/runner

# add new subcommand
cobra add <CHILD_COMMAND> -p <PARENT_COMMAND>

# example:
cobra add childCommand -p 'parentCommand'
```

### Running the Server

During CLI or even server development, you will likely want to run the server during testing.

In the root directory `runner`, you can run the API a couple ways:

```bash
# 1. use the Makefile
make run-api

# 2. just use the go command
go run api/main.go
```

Usually you'll want to run the server in the background to you can do other
things with your terminal. However, you'd need to kill the process running on port `8080`
once you're done. You can use the `api/kill_server.sh` script for this.

```bash
# 1. run the API in the background
go run api/main.go &

# 2. once you are done, use the script to shut down processes on port 8080
./api/kill_server.sh

```

You can also use the `api/kill_server.sh` script if you see this error:

> error starting server: listen tcp :8080: bind: address already in use

### Go Tips

#### Working with Go Modules

Go Module:

```bash
# you usually will not have to run this since we should already have a go.mod and go.sum file
go mod init github.com/<name>/<repo-name>

# add new library
go get <new dependency>

# organize modules and dependencies
go mod tidy

# remove dependency
go mod edit -dropreplace github.com/go-chi/chi
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

**What are unit tests and why do we use them?**

Unit testing is used to help us make sure smaller "units" of the code
work as expected and handle all expected error cases. This project will end up being pretty
large and we want to use unit tests to verify individual components before
piecing everything together.

In [runner_test.go](https://github.com/camerondurham/runner/blob/b594c4e023009d06109eb206c2f3e288dddd5e4c/engine/coderunner/runner_test.go#L25-L38),
we mock the response of the runtime to isolate what we are testing and produce
consist results without actually calling our "real code" in the `runtime`
module.

More about unit tests: [Definition of a Unit Test](https://www.artofunittesting.com/definition-of-a-unit-test).

**How to generate mocks:**

Install the Go CLI `mockgen` to create mocks from [Go interfaces](https://gobyexample.com/interfaces):

```bash
go install github.com/golang/mock/mockgen@v1.6.0
```

Using Mockgen to create new mocks for testing:

Basic command structure:

```bash
mockgen -source ./path/to/file/with/filename.go -destinaion ./path/to/write/mocks/filename.go InterfaceName
```

Example:

In `engine/runtime/types.go` there is the interface `Runtime` that we would like to mock for unit tests:

```go
type Runtime interface {
  RunCmd(runprops *RunProps) (*RunOutput, error)
}
```

The command below will create a mock-able `Runtime` interface, helper functions to implement
`Runtime` that you can call `RunCmd` on.

We can organize mocks in a submodule by making the `engine/runtime/mocks` directory and provide that and a filename to write the mocked classes.

```bash
mockgen -source ./engine/runtime/types.go -package=mocks -destination ./engine/runtime/mocks/Runtime.go Runtime
```

You can see an example [here](https://github.com/camerondurham/runner/blob/b594c4e023009d06109eb206c2f3e288dddd5e4c/engine/coderunner/runner_test.go#L25-L38)
of how to actually use mocks in a unit test.

> Note: The command above has been added to the `Makefile`. If you are creating mocks
> you want for a new file or interface, feel free to add those commands to the
> `gen-mocks` target so these are generated when you run `make gen-mocks`.

## Integration Testing

Will add more about this later! Here's some [reading](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/IntegrationTest.html) from Martin Fowler for now!

There aren't examples of integration testing in the repo yet.

## Documentation

When writing instructions for users and in the README, please follow syntax recommended by [google developer docs](https://developers.google.com/style/code-syntax)

## Other things

### Change package name (just in case)

```bash
# change module name in all files
 find . -type f \( -name '*.go' -o -name '*.mod' \) -exec sed -i -e "s;runner-x;runner;g" {} +
```
