# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will establish a dedicated pre-production development test environment that allows developers to test changes before deploying to the main production environment. The system will include both backend API testing on a staging Fly.io instance and frontend testing with environment-specific configuration, enabling comprehensive integration testing without affecting production users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy my changes to a pre-production environment, so that I can test the full system integration before merging to main and deploying to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer pushes to a designated staging branch (e.g., `staging` or `develop`) THEN the system SHALL automatically deploy the backend to a separate Fly.io staging instance
2. WHEN the staging deployment completes THEN the system SHALL be accessible at a staging-specific URL (e.g., `runner-staging.fly.dev`)
3. WHEN the staging environment is deployed THEN it SHALL use the same Docker configuration as production but with staging-specific environment variables
4. IF the staging deployment fails THEN the system SHALL notify developers and prevent the deployment from completing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to automatically connect to the appropriate backend environment, so that I can test the complete user experience in the staging environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend is built for staging THEN it SHALL automatically configure API endpoints to point to the staging backend URL
2. WHEN a developer builds the frontend locally THEN they SHALL be able to specify which environment (local, staging, production) to target
3. WHEN the staging frontend is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible at a staging-specific URL distinct from production
4. WHEN environment configuration changes THEN the frontend SHALL rebuild automatically with the correct API endpoints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated testing in the staging environment, so that I can verify my changes work correctly before production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is deployed to staging THEN the system SHALL run automated integration tests against the staging environment
2. WHEN staging tests pass THEN the system SHALL indicate the staging environment is ready for manual testing
3. WHEN staging tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent promotion to production and notify developers
4. WHEN manual testing is complete THEN developers SHALL be able to promote the staging deployment to production

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want staging environment isolation, so that staging tests and experiments don't affect production users or data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the staging environment runs THEN it SHALL use completely separate infrastructure from production
2. WHEN staging processes execute user code THEN they SHALL use the same security constraints as production
3. WHEN staging environment resources are created THEN they SHALL be clearly labeled as staging to prevent confusion
4. WHEN staging environment is no longer needed THEN resources SHALL be easily identifiable for cleanup

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want easy promotion from staging to production, so that I can deploy tested changes with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN staging testing is complete THEN developers SHALL be able to promote the exact same code to production
2. WHEN promotion occurs THEN the system SHALL use the same Docker image that was tested in staging
3. WHEN promotion is initiated THEN the system SHALL run final production deployment checks
4. IF promotion fails THEN the system SHALL maintain the previous production version and alert developers
