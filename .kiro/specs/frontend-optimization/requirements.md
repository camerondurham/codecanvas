# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current web frontend has significant performance issues with bundle sizes exceeding 1MB, primarily due to the CodeMirror editor dependency. The main bundle warnings show the editor entrypoint at 1.06 MiB and index entrypoint at 696 KiB, both well above the recommended 244 KiB limit. This optimization effort aims to reduce bundle sizes while maintaining or improving the current functionality and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web application to load quickly, so that I can start coding without waiting for large JavaScript bundles to download.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the initial bundle size SHALL be under 244 KiB as recommended by webpack
2. WHEN the editor is needed THEN it SHALL load asynchronously without blocking the initial page load
3. WHEN measuring load times THEN the Time to Interactive SHALL be reduced by at least 50% compared to current implementation
4. WHEN on slow network connections THEN the application SHALL remain usable within 3 seconds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want an optimized build process, so that bundle analysis and performance monitoring are built into the development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for production THEN the build process SHALL generate a bundle analysis report
2. WHEN bundle sizes exceed thresholds THEN the build process SHALL fail with clear error messages
3. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN unused code SHALL be automatically tree-shaken
4. WHEN building THEN code splitting SHALL be applied to separate vendor libraries from application code

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the code editor to load efficiently, so that I can start editing code without experiencing performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the editor component is requested THEN it SHALL load via dynamic import
2. WHEN the editor loads THEN only the required CodeMirror modules SHALL be included
3. WHEN switching between different language modes THEN additional language support SHALL load on-demand
4. WHEN the editor is not needed on a page THEN its code SHALL not be included in the initial bundle

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to evaluate framework migration options, so that I can make an informed decision about the frontend architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating frameworks THEN bundle size impact SHALL be measured and compared
2. WHEN considering migration THEN development velocity impact SHALL be assessed
3. WHEN analyzing options THEN compatibility with existing backend APIs SHALL be verified
4. IF migration is chosen THEN it SHALL result in smaller bundle sizes than current implementation
5. IF staying with vanilla JS THEN optimization techniques SHALL achieve comparable performance to framework alternatives

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent performance across all application features, so that no single feature causes the entire application to become slow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using any application feature THEN no single feature SHALL contribute more than 100 KiB to the initial bundle
2. WHEN features are not immediately needed THEN they SHALL be loaded lazily
3. WHEN the application starts THEN only core functionality SHALL be loaded initially
4. WHEN measuring performance THEN each page SHALL meet Core Web Vitals thresholds

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want maintainable optimization solutions, so that performance improvements don't compromise code quality or development experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing optimizations THEN code readability SHALL not be significantly reduced
2. WHEN adding new features THEN the optimization strategy SHALL accommodate future growth
3. WHEN debugging THEN source maps SHALL remain available in development builds
4. WHEN testing THEN the optimization approach SHALL not interfere with existing test strategies
